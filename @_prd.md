### ✅ **PRD Checklist – MSU Multilingual Enrollment Support System**

#### 1. 📌 **Project Overview**

* [ ] Clear problem statement (manual workload, info delay, language barrier)
* [ ] Vision statement (real-time AI chatbot for multilingual enrollment support)
* [ ] Success criteria (response accuracy, engagement rate, staff workload reduction)

---

#### 2. 🧠 **Core Functional Requirements**

**AI-Powered Chatbot:**

* [ ] Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* [ ] Implement LangChain for chaining prompt + retrieval logic
* [ ] Support Groq API or alternate high-speed LLMs (e.g. Qwen, OpenRouter)

**Document-Based Information Retrieval:**

* [ ] PDF parsing module (course fees, prerequisites, intakes)
* [ ] Structured schema for extracted data
* [ ] Admin interface to upload/update documents

**Multilingual Support:**

* [ ] Input/output translation pipeline
* [ ] Language auto-detection
* [ ] Toggle/select language manually
* [ ] Translation model benchmarking (accuracy vs. latency)

**User Experience Layer:**

* [ ] Front-end chat UI (web-based)
* [ ] Persistent chat session (retain history unless cleared manually)
* [ ] Anonymous session UUID or IP-based session retention (if no login)
* [ ] Manual “Clear Chat” option
* [ ] Real-time typing indicator + thinking animation

**Admin Dashboard:**

* [ ] PDF upload manager
* [ ] Document status/validity logs
* [ ] Query log viewer
* [ ] FAQ generation/summary tool from logs
* [ ] User analytics dashboard

---

#### 3. 🔒 **Security & Compliance**

* [ ] Input sanitization (to prevent injection)
* [ ] Session handling without login (via UUID/IP, optional encryption)
* [ ] GDPR/PDPA alignment for user interactions
* [ ] Role-based access for admin panel

---

#### 4. 🚀 **Performance Requirements**

* [ ] Sub-2s average response time
* [ ] Handle concurrent sessions (scaling strategy via threading or queue)
* [ ] Fallback/default responses for unhandled queries

---

#### 5. 🧪 **Testing Requirements**

* [ ] Unit tests (LangChain chains, PDF extractor, translator)
* [ ] End-to-end flow test (user query → response)
* [ ] Multilingual accuracy test set
* [ ] UI/UX feedback loop from users

---

#### 6. 🔧 **Technical Setup**

* [ ] RAG + LangChain environment setup (via FastAPI or Flask)
* [ ] Translation layer (Argos, LibreTranslate, or Qwen)
* [ ] Frontend integration (Streamlit or custom HTML/JS)
* [ ] Deployment config (Docker + Gunicorn)
* [ ] Hosting strategy (local server vs. cloud)

---

#### 7. 📈 **Future-Proofing**

* [ ] Plug-and-play language model support
* [ ] Extendable FAQ database
* [ ] API integration ready (for internal MSU systems)
